            <p>My name is Justin and I am from Seattle, WA. I was born and raised here, so I miss our Sonics but love
                our Seahawks (GO HAWKS). I am a long time student of life.. and of the University of Washington, but
                decided to take some time off to enroll in this coding bootcamp! I have always been into
                computers/technology in general, so I felt that this would be an exciting challenge for me to take on. I
                really enjoy creating and building things, whether that be computer, car or even kitchen related. I try
                to maintain an active lifestyle by playing sports and working out consistently, while also making time
                for listening to music, reading, watching movies/tv shows and playing video games.</p>
            <p>My favorite music genre is Hip-Hop/Rap, but I listen to a variety of genres. I tend to read a lot of
                fiction books, with one of my favorites being <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i> by Haruki Murakami. My
                all-time favorite show is HBO's 'The Wire,' and I can't say I have a favorite video game, but I play a
                lot of shooters and RPGs. I have two dogs which are crazy and I also like drinking beer, so I am always
                down to drink after class! Looking forward to the next 5.5 months of this bootcamp.</p>
